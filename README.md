# NFA_to_DFA
A python script to convert a Nondeterministic finite automaton to a deterministic finite automaton.

Script read input.json file containing an object which represents a NFA. This json object will have 5 key-value pairs corresponding to the 5-tuple used to represent the NFA.

Output is a DFA with 2^n states.
